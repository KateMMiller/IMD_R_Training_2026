#### Day 1 Goals
<b>Overall goals for the first day are: </b>

1. Get comfortable navigating RStudio IDE, such as opening a new project or script, running code and viewing the output, etc. 
2. Ability to import and save CSV and .xlsx files.
3. Basic understanding of variables, functions, and data frames.
4. Ability to explore data frames, such as the number of columns, min/max of different columns, data type of column, basic plotting, etc. 
5. Basic understanding of square brackets to view and filter data[,]. This is probably the hardest concept you'll learn this week. The next two days I will show you easier ways to work with your data that don't involve brackets.
6. Able to access help within and outside of R.
